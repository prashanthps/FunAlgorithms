Algos from some of my favorite problems

Divide and Conquer recursive algorithms (written in Python 2.7)

1. Counting Split Inversions (uses Merge Sort Algorithm): CountInversions.py
2. Counting number comparisons in QuickSort: Comparisoncount.py
3. splitter.py: Given an list of positive integers, split it into two equal sum lists if a solution exists.
